## 📌 Built-in Shortcodes (in plugin)

| Shortcode | Description |
|---|---|
| `[cb_categories]` | Department slider (carousel) |
| `[cb_latest_course]` | Latest single course card |

---

## 📌 Extra Shortcodes (add to functions.php)

These are standalone PHP files to paste into `functions.php` or Code Snippets:

### `cb-courses-shortcode.php`
```
[cb_courses]
[cb_courses limit="10"]
```
Infinite-loop slider of CB courses. Same design as Tutor LMS `tutor_essential_courses_v3`. Shows Live Classes, Duration, Suitable Age, Learn More.

---

### `cb-departments-shortcode.php`
```
[cb_categories]
```
Department category slider. Exact replica of `tutor_parent_categories_v3`. Uses `cb_category` taxonomy + `cb_image_id` term meta.

---

### `cb-department-courses.php`
```
[cb_department_courses]
```
All departments as pill tabs. Click a tab → courses appear below in a grid. Same card design as `[cb_courses]`.

---

### `cb-category-courses.php`
```
[cb_category_courses]
```
**Single page handles ALL departments automatically.**

**Setup (one time only):**
1. Create a WordPress page with slug: `course-category`
2. Add shortcode `[cb_category_courses]`
3. Go to Settings → Permalinks → Save Changes

Then every URL like `/course-category/english-language/` auto-shows matching courses with a full-width hero banner.

---

### `cb-teachers-carousel.php`
```
[cb_teachers]
[cb_teachers count="10"]
```
Teacher carousel. Pixel-perfect replica of `teachers_carousel` shortcode. Uses `cb_teacher` post type, reads `_cb_photo_id` and `_cb_designation`. 4 cards on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile.

---

### `cb-mycourses-thumbnail.php`
Replaces the LMSACE My Courses thumbnail lookup. Instead of fetching from Tutor LMS (`_tutor_course_product_id`), fetches from Course Builder (`_cb_wc_product_id` → `cb_course` thumbnail).

---

## 🛡️ Data Safety

By default, **all data is preserved** when you update or reinstall the plugin.

To enable full cleanup on uninstall:
1. Go to **Course Builder → Settings**
2. Tick "Delete ALL data when plugin is uninstalled"
3. Save

---

## 🔄 Updating the Plugin

1. Upload new zip via **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**
2. Click **Replace current with uploaded**
3. Done — all courses, teachers, and departments are preserved

---

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

### Teacher page 404
Go to **Settings → Permalinks → Save Changes**

### Courses stuck on "Loading..."
Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R). If still loading, check browser console for JS errors.

### Featured image not showing
Open the course in admin, set the featured image, and save once. The image is stored in both `_thumbnail_id` and `_cb_photo_id`.

### Category courses page not working
Make sure:
- Page slug is exactly `course-category`  
- Department slug in Course Builder matches the URL segment
- Go to Settings → Permalinks → Save Changes after creating the page

---

## 📊 Database Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `wp_posts` | cb_course, cb_teacher posts |
| `wp_postmeta` | All `_cb_*` meta fields |
| `wp_terms` | cb_category terms |
| `wp_term_taxonomy` | cb_category taxonomy rows |
| `wp_termmeta` | `cb_image_id` per category |
